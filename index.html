            I was a curios kid since the age I can remember. My curiosity always attached with my steals, which now turned into inspirations. I remeber few of my childhood steals and my mom corrected me return that thing back to where it belongs. Meet me offline to know few of them. I haven’t forgot my art of stealing but it transformed in being an artist and steal like an artist. Later I indulged into sketching and painting and I did mastered it in few years, but later till my high school I realised that I loosed that mastery faster than I mastered it when I stopped practising it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then when High School arrived it was the time when IITs & Engineering colleges were at its boom. But I knew I couldn’t master science in this short span of time of just two years the way others do it after my own failed attempts. But I was brave enough to even take that challenge, but at different intervals I used to keep telling my parents (elder brother, mom & grandfather) that my interest is something else (it was to excel in animation techniques I was learning myself alongside), but they are pretty old school Indian parents that time. And as I knew I couldn’t, so do I failed in pretigious JEE exams, but was smart enough to ask my parents to prepare one more year for it as I needed some time to figure out what I have to do next.

        <p>
            And I did managed to get my parents agreed to get me into an Animation School in Delhi before next JEE exam in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left that quite soon, and joined another Film School to study Sound Design whose need I felt in my last Animation School studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I do found my curios fulfilments with the studies of Computer Science during my Albany Days at Massey University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came back to India in late 2017 and learn the Art of Salary Negotitaion in India along with the tech terms used there that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did pretty good in India by working with many amazing Companies and my last Company was an Investment Bank, just like many Indian MBA Sagas but without studying in IIMs, but ya my IIM flatmate helped me crack my last interview, just being honest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I try to solve hard and amazing problems @ LoudCurtain as I serve as CTO which I Founded in 2021 along with my Co-Founder Neetica Pande.
